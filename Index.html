        There are so many eevee lifes around the internet, but they were got in paintings or documents.<br>
        Have you ever seen one of pokemon's diary? Maybe this time is first, I sware!<br>
        You are very lucky today! Let's see how sylveon think other eeveelutions!<br>
        What you want to see first?

        <p style="margin-top:50px">
        <h1>HI! MY FRIEND!</h1>
        I've already know you will see this, glaceon! And this is why I start to write my diary.
        I love all other eeveelutions, but every time we meet we just hang out. My mind always really deep and new to them.
        I want to tell every aspect of your beauty. but as we enjoy together in that time and I was so shy to speak that, I decided to tell it in writing.<br>
